## Required Dependencies

### Homebrew package manager

Install with the following command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```


See [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for more information.

### Nerd Fonts for Power Line symbols

Visit [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for available fonts.

The *Ocean (Meslo)* Terminal Profile uses `Meslo LG L Regular Nerd Font Complete Mono 14` so I recommend installing at least this font. (Also, consider installing [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) for use in your favorite editor.)

### Oh My Posh for customized prompt

Install with the following command:

``` zsh
brew install jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh/oh-my-posh
```

See [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/macos#installation) for how to customize and more information.
